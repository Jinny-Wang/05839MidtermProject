To get an overall idea about the space -- A space this size in a Village hotel would cost at least $600 a night.  Our price reflects the fact that this is a permanent home to a family with pets.  We offer it for rent when we are out of town.  It is clean and charming and homey but it is not pristine and modern and full of amenities as a hotel would be!  And the price reflects that!
